When the assignment is due, a classroom website will compress all of submissions into a single zip file so one can download, unzip, and run
your codes. Each of submission will be renamed by Blackboard following a certain rule. Specifically,
the (new) file name encodes the assignment name, the submitter’s username, date and time of the
attempt, and the original file name of the submission. 

For example, if I were a student and I submit my
Homework.cpp file to the assignment hw1 on January 30, 16:40:55, the file name will be
hw1_dchakrabarti_attempt_2023-01-30-16-40-55_Homework.cpp

The first part is the assignment name, followed by the submitter’s username, followed by
the word “attempt”, followed by the date and time in the YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS format, followed by
the original file name. Different parts are separated by an underscore ‘_’.

This program takes a string corresponding to a filename with the classroom website's rule, and return the
assignment name, the username, the original file name, the date of the submission, and the time of the
submission.
